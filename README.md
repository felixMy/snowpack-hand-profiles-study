# SNOWPACK Hand Profile Study
Code and analysis for improving SNOWPACK model output by integrating manually recorded snow profiles, focusing on avalanche hazard assessment and weak layer prediction.

This repository contains the data and code used for the validation study of the SNOWPACK model with manually recorded snow profiles. 

Published as a poster at the [International Snow Science Workshop 2024](https://www.issw2024.com).

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is structured in the followinf way:
- `data/`: Contains the recorded and simulated snow profiles used in the study as well as the corresponding weather data
- `scripts/`: Porvides the scripts used to process and analyze the data
- `results/`: Summarizes the results of the study
- `publication/`: Holds the official proceeding from the ISSW2024 of the study.
