# SNOWPACK INI-Files
This folder contains the ini-files used for the SNOWPACK simulations. 
The files are named according to the scheme: 
`<location>_<simulation_type>.ini`

We used two different types of simulations:
- `aws`: Simulations puerly based on the AWS data starting from the beginning of the winter season. 
- `hand_profile`: Simulations based on the hand-profiles starting from the date of the hand-profile.
