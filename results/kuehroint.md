# Comparision KÃ¼hrointalm 1420m
Changes & Settings:
- Grain size of the first two layers (new snow & decomposed snow) are reduzed to 0,5mm (originally 5mm and 1,5mm)
- The reference profile is taken as SNOWPACK read-in: A simulation was started with the same start date as the reference profile and the reference profile itself as initial profile. From this simulation the first generated profile from the PRO-File was extracted. 
- Simulations based on the hand-profile do NOT need to match the measured snow hight (`enforce_measured_snow_heights = FALSE`)
- Simulations based on the hand-profile have `CAAML_MAX_ELEMENT_THICKNESS` NOT set
- `rescale2refHS = TRUE`
