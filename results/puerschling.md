# Comparision for the PÃ¼rschling Site (1566m)

## Changes & Settings
- The reference profile is taken as SNOWPACK read-in: A simulation was started with the same start date as the reference profile and the reference profile itself as initial profile. From this simulation the first generated profile from the PRO-File was extracted. 
- Simulations based on the hand-profile do NOT need to match the measured snow hight (`enforce_measured_snow_heights = FALSE`)
- Simulations based on the hand-profile have `CAAML_MAX_ELEMENT_THICKNESS` NOT set
- `rescale2refHS = TRUE`
